Revision history for Perl extension Physics::Particles.

1.02  Fri Mar 16 19:33:12 2007
  - Corrected bug in examples/example2.pl

1.01  Mon Oct 10 21:25:38 2005
	- Switched to Module::Build
	- Generate distribution upgrades.

1.00  Sun Jul  6 17:54:49 2003
	- Interface changes!
	- Rewrote parts of the module to increase accuracy
	- Forces aren't supposed to modify particles directly now
	  but instead return a force vector.
	- Due to the changes mentioned above, the inner-solar-system
	  simulation broke. Can't get it to work because of the damned
	  constants involved. There are, however, better examples
	  in the Physics::Springs and Physics::Springs::Friction modules.

0.10  Wed Mar 26 12:32:56 2003
