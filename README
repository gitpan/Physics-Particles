Physics::Particles version 1.02
===============================

This module simulates a system of particles and the forces they
excert on one another.

As of version 1.00, there has been a major interface change and hence,

Furthermore, Physics::Particles version 1.00 is not compatible to
versions of Physics::Springs and Physics::Springs::Friction below 1.00.
